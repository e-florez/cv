**Profile:** As a data scientist with a profound background in quantum
chemistry, biophysics, and mathematics, I bring over eight years of
experience to the table, having served as a scientific algorithm
developer, data scientist, and team leader. My passion lies in
extracting fundamental insights from data, thinking critically, and
understanding the rationale behind each task. With my ability to learn
quickly and motivation to take on challenges, I have excelled as an
individual contributor, taking calculated risks and showing initiative.
My experience spans consulting for a biotech startup and the financial
industry, where I developed scientific software, validated scalable HPC
algorithms, and worked collaboratively to deliver top-quality,
data-driven scientific solutions and visualizations. I have a track
record of solving complex problems through algorithm development in
research labs in New Zealand, Argentina, and Colombia. In the role of a
teacher, I've mentored students in two large universities, simplifying
complex scientific concepts, methods, and theories in science, math, and
computers. In my spare time, I enjoy intellectual pursuits like reading,
writing, and learning new things. I am also freelance as an editor and
reviewer for scientific manuscripts and research for publication.

**Open-Source [Contributions](.)**

- **Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC):** This project introduces
  an advanced Fortran (2003) code that uses the Parallel Tempering
  Monte Carlo (PTMC) method for an accurate and efficient analysis of
  phase transitions in atomic and molecular clusters. Our application
  includes studying melting transitions of noble gases and water
  clusters, even in ultra-high magnetic fields. The code is
  parallelized using OpenMP and it is optimized for HPC architectures.
  The code is open-source and available on
  [github.com/e-florez/PTMC](https://github.com/e-florez/PTMC)

- **Atomic and Molecular Cluster Energy Surface Sampler (AMCESS):** An
  open-source Python package that automates the exploration of the
  Potential Energy Surface (PES) for atomic and molecular clusters.
  AMCESS uses advanced optimization techniques to generate candidate
  structures for critical points on the PES, enhancing research
  accuracy and efficiency. Its user-friendly design and integration
  with popular quantum chemistry packages make it a valuable tool for
  researchers in molecular physics, chemistry, and materials science.
  AMCESS code is available on
  [gitlab.com/ADanianZE/amcess](https://gitlab.com/ADanianZE/amcess)

- **Cluster Compare (pyCC):** Python project designed to analyze and
  compare atomic and molecular clusters. The main script is created to
  orchestrate a rigorous and insightful comparison of cluster data,
  facilitating a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties
  and interactions. pyCC uses a range of data analysis and machine
  learning modules to derive key cluster features from atomic
  coordinates and bond patterns, including radial and angular
  distributions, and various similarity descriptors. By harnessing
  libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn, it provides a
  specialized, versatile framework for a comparative study of atomic
  and molecular clusters. The code is open-source and available on
