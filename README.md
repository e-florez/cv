**Profile:** As a data scientist with a profound background in
statistics, linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and mathematics, I bring
over eight years of experience, having served as a data scientist,
business analyst, researcher, developer, and team leader. My passion
lies in extracting fundamental insights from data, thinking critically,
and understanding the rationale behind each task. With my ability to
learn quickly and motivation to take on challenges, I have excelled as a
team player and individual contributor, taking calculated risks and
showing initiative. In my spare time, I enjoy intellectual pursuits like
drawing and writing about science fiction. I am a beer and cycling
enthusiast, although not all simultaneously.

# Professional [Experience](.)
