# Professional [Experience](.)

- **Data Scientist**[Aug.2021 - Aug 2023](.)\
  HelicoBio \[[helico.bio](www.helico.bio)\], New Zealand

  COMPUTATIONAL PROTEIN DESIGNER: Leveraging in-depth knowledge of
  biophysics and protein design, I created and validated scalable
  pipelines to advance plant biology research. As a `DATA SCIENTIST`,
  I collaborated with cross-functional groups to deliver high-quality,
  data-driven solutions. My role involves collecting and preparing
  data, finding insights, and creating easy-to-understand visuals. I
  contributed to all phases of the software development lifecycle
  including the development, testing, and deployment of new
  functionalities using Python and C++. A notable achievement was
  leading the development of a pipeline, a protein design platform
  enabling the execution of comprehensive all-atom molecular dynamics
  simulations, which are instrumental in understanding protein
  dynamics and function.
