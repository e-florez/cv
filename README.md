**Profile:** As a data scientist with a profound background in quantum
chemistry, biophysics, and mathematics, I bring over eight years of
experience to the table, having served as a scientific algorithm
developer, data scientist, and team leader. My passion lies in
extracting fundamental insights from data, thinking critically, and
understanding the rationale behind each task. With my ability to learn
quickly and motivation to take on challenges, I have excelled as an
individual contributor, taking calculated risks and showing initiative.
My experience spans consulting for biotech startups and the financial
industry, where I develop scientific software, validate scalable HPC
algorithms, and work collaboratively to deliver top-quality, data-driven
scientific solutions and visualizations. I have a track record of
solving complex problems through algorithm development in research labs
in New Zealand, Argentina, and Colombia. In the role of a teacher, I've
mentored students in two large universities, simplifying complex
scientific concepts, methods, and theories in science, math, and
computers. In my spare time, I enjoy intellectual pursuits like reading,
writing, and learning new things. I am also freelance as an editor and
reviewer for scientific manuscripts and research for publication.
