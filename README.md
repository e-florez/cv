# Professional [Experience](.)

- **Data Scientist**[**Aug.2021 - Aug 2023**](.)\
  HelicoBio \[[helico.bio](www.helico.bio)\], New Zealand

  I created and validated scalable data pipelines to advance plant
  biology research, collaborating with cross-functional groups to
  design new functionalities and ensure their seamless deployment. My
  role involves collecting and preparing data, extracting insights,
  and creating easy-to-understand visuals. I contributed to all phases
  of the software development lifecycle, including the development,
  testing, and deployment of new functionalities using Python and C++.
  **[Achievement:](.)** I led the development of a data pipeline that
  enabled the execution of comprehensive all-atom molecular dynamics
  simulations. This advancement has reduced wet-lab workflows by 20%,
  significantly enhancing our understanding of protein function in the
  context of designing new proteins.

- **Freelancer Editor**\
  Enago \[[enago.com](https://www.enago.com/)\], Remote [**Since
  Apr.2023**](.)\
  MDPI \[[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/)\], Remote [**Apr.2018 -
  Dec.2018**](.)

  I provide Copy Editing services, refining grammar and scientific
  terminology. Additionally, I offer Substantive Editing, improving
  manuscript structure, clarifying ambiguous text, and verifying
  citation relevance. **[Achievement:](.)** I assisted authors aiming
  for high-impact journals in adhering to journal styles, monitored
  writing and editing activities, and ensured content clarity and
  accuracy increasing by more than 30% desk acceptance.

- **Teaching/Lab Assistant and Demonstrator** [**Aug.2018 -
  Mar.2020**](.)\
  Massey University \[[massey.ac.nz](www.massey.ac.nz)\], New Zealand

  I provide instruction and guidance to students in workshops,
  focusing on intricate subjects such as advanced mechanics,
  thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism, and circuit analysis.
  Through my role, I significantly contribute to improving students'
  comprehension of these intricate physical concepts and principles
  using Python. **[Achievement:](.)** I played a key role in designing
  the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Physics Lab. This
  design has been pivotal in automating experiments and utilizing
  tools like Jupyter, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and
  report presentation.

- **Data Scientist**[**Aug.2016 - Mar.2018**](.)\
  EY \[[ey.com](www.ey.com)\], Colombia.

  I specialize in crafting tailored solutions through thorough
  business and technical analyses, primarily within SAP for Analytical
  Banking and Business Intelligence. My expertise lies in developing
  complex models to address economic challenges, and implementing them
  to provide customized solutions. I designed and implemented
  mathematical models to tackle financial inquiries, offering
  detail-oriented and pragmatic resolutions. **[Achievement:](.)** I
  designed a Python module to read, clean, and encrypt financial
  information for generating test cases to train new users of a bank's
  bonds portfolio. This innovation has halved the time required for
  designing and implementing new training sessions.

- **Graduate Teaching Assistant**[**Sept.2015 - Aug.2016**](.)\
  University of Antioquia \[[udea.edu.co](www.udea.edu.co)\],
  Colombia.

  I guide advanced college students through the intricate domain of
  Quantum Mechanics. My role involves ensuring that students achieve
  proficiency in the language of quantum mechanics, comprehend
  relevant methods, and grasp key concepts. **[Achievement:](.)** I
  played a significant role in the development of new modules,
  "Computational Quantum Mechanics with Python", which were
  implemented within the Quantum Chemistry subject. These modules have
  notably enhanced students' understanding of the quantum language and
  its practical application in the field of computational chemistry.
