    \item \textbf{Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC):}
          This project introduces an advanced Fortran (2003) code that uses the Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC) method for an accurate and efficient analysis of phase transitions in atomic and molecular clusters. Code available on \href{https://github.com/e-florez/PTMC}{github.com/e-florez/PTMC}

    \item \textbf{Atomic and Molecular Cluster Energy Surface Sampler (AMCESS):}
          An open-source Python package that automates the exploration of the Potential Energy Surface (PES) for atomic and molecular clusters. AMCESS uses advanced optimization techniques to generate candidate structures for critical points on the PES, enhancing research accuracy and efficiency. Code available on

          %     \item \textbf{Cluster Compare (pyCC):}
          %           Python project designed to analyze and compare atomic and molecular clusters. The main script is created to orchestrate a rigorous and insightful comparison of cluster data, facilitating a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties and interactions.
