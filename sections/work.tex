              {\bf Research:}
          It spans topics in Computational Physics and Chemistry, with an emphasis on computational modeling. In particular, I am interested in the ab initio description of ground state properties of atoms in high magnetic fields and relativistic effects of atomic and molecular systems. Additionally, in the description of phase transitions like melting in nanoclusters and extended systems under strong magnetic fields and understanding the emergence of their bulk properties. I have expertise in the fields of importance-sampling Monte Carlo, optimization technics, molecular dynamics methods, and electronic structure calculations.
