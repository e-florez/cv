                  \textbf{Computational Protein Designer:}
                  Leveraging in-depth knowledge of biophysics and protein design, I created and validated scalable algorithms to advance plant biology research. As a team leader, I collaborated with cross-functional groups to deliver high-quality, data-driven scientific solutions. I contributed to all phases of the software development lifecycle, including the development, testing, and deployment of new functionalities using Python, C++, and SQL. A notable achievement was leading the development of a protein design platform for running all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. I have direct experience using Molecular Dynamics packages like GROMACS, AMBER and OpenMM, also Alphafold and other bioinformatics tools. I am also proficient in using various computational tools such as virtual screening and docking.
