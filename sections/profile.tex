            % Getting insight from data.
            % Chemistry by training and physics at heart, speaking computer language.
            As a data scientist, I bring over eight years of experience, having served as a researcher, algorithm developer, business analyst, and team leader. My passion lies in extracting fundamental insights from data, thinking critically, and understanding the rationale behind each task. With my ability to learn quickly and motivation to take on challenges, I have excelled as a team player and individual contributor, taking calculated risks and showing initiative. In my spare time, I enjoy intellectual pursuits like drawing and writing about science fiction.
            I am a beer and cycling enthusiast, although not all simultaneously.
            %I am also freelance as an editor and reviewer for scientific manuscripts and research for publication.
