            % Getting insight from data.
            % Chemistry by training and physics at heart, speaking computer language.
            As a data scientist with a profound background in quantum mechanics, biophysics, and mathematics, I bring over eight years of experience, having served as a researcher, algorithm developer, data scientist, business analyst and team leader. My passion lies in extracting fundamental insights from data, thinking critically, and understanding the rationale behind each task. With my ability to learn quickly and motivation to take on challenges, I have excelled as a team player and individual contributor, taking calculated risks and showing initiative. My experience spans consulting for biotech startups and the financial industry, where I develop and validate scalable algorithms, and work collaboratively to deliver top-quality, data-driven solutions. In my spare time, I enjoy intellectual pursuits like drawing and writing about science fiction. I am a beer and cycling enthusiast, although not all simultaneously.
