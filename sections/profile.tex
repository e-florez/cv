            My path started in computational chemistry and physics, where my Ph.D. work focused on modeling complex systems from first principles. This taught me how to break down complex problems into their fundamental parts. I have applied this analytical approach from academia, biotech and to the financial sector, where I learned to connect technical work to business outcomes. Today, I use this combined perspective to build analytical solutions that are both scientifically sound and commercially viable. My work combines AI, science, and cloud computing to solve challenges that affect food security.
